# SkillRelay
## Its an Open Source Freelance Platform developed in html,css and javascript as First Semester Project.

Welcome to the project repository! This guide provides instructions for setting up and collaborating effectively. The repository contains the initial setup, including three folders: `assets`, `scripts`, `styles`, and standalone `HTML` files.

## Project Structure

├── assets/
├── scripts/
├── styles/
├── index.html
├── about.html
└── contact.html


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to start working on the project:

### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Switch to the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

### Creating Your Personal Branch

Each collaborator will create a branch with their name to work on features.

- **Ali Hassan:**
  ```bash
  git checkout -b alihassan
  ```

- **Ahmed Ali:**
  ```bash
  git checkout -b ahmedali
  ```

### Working on Features

1. Inside your branch, create sub-branches for specific features:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <feature-name>
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b client-dashboard
   ```

2. Work on the code and commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: <feature-name>"
   ```

3. Push your changes to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

### Merging Sub-Branches into Your Main Branch

1. Switch to your main branch (e.g., `alihassan`):
   ```bash
   git checkout alihassan
   ```

2. Merge a sub-branch:
   ```bash
   git merge <feature-name>
   ```

3. Push the updates:
   ```bash
   git push origin alihassan
   ```

### Merging Personal Branch into Main

1. Ensure all your sub-branches are merged into your personal branch.
2. Switch to the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

3. Merge your personal branch:
   ```bash
   git merge <your-branch-name>
   ```

4. Push the updates to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Collaboration Guidelines

1. **Branch Naming:** Use clear and descriptive names for branches and features.
2. **Commit Messages:** Write meaningful commit messages to explain the purpose of changes.
3. **Conflict Resolution:** Communicate with other collaborators to resolve merge conflicts.


Happy coding!
